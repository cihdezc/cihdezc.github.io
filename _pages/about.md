I'm an associate researcher at the department of computer science IIMAS-UNAM. I'm passionate about decision making and optimization in particular when the process has several conflicting objectives and subject to uncertainties.

Interests
======
*  Multi-objective optimization
*  Evolutionary computation
*  Optimization under uncertainty
*  Decision making
*  Reinforcement learning
*  Automatic configuration of algorithms
